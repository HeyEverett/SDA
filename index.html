      <p style=> Sponsored Residential Services are services provided in a person's private home to individuals who are intellectually disabled. The individual actually resides with the person or family. Those who provide this service are called sponsors, and oversight is provided by an agency that holds a Sponsored Residential license issued by the Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services. </p>

        <!-- One of the main goals of the program is to introduce individuals who are cognitively and maybe physically or behaviorally challenged into a home/family environment that promotes normalization. <br> <br> Unlike group homes or institutional settings, the individual would become a part of your family.
        The sponsor does have to meet certain licensing requirements and is closely monitored by Residential Service staff through regular home visits.<br><br>In addition to the licensing requirements, the sponsor is also required to complete an array of trainings, criminal background and central registry checks; and maintain a service record with accurate up to date documentation for each individual they serve.
        If you (and your family) have a desire to care for someone that requires 24 hour supervision, training and supports, please call us for a personal interview or complete the Sponsored Home Information Sheet and fax it to 804-5621. </p> -->

          <h3 style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"> Shareen Young-chavez  </h3>
        <p> 
          Shareen Young-Chavez is the mother of a beautiful son, Stefon, 18, who has multiple disabilities,
          including Angelman syndrome (a genetic deficiency of the 15th chromosome), cerebral palsy, an
          intellectual disability, epilepsy, asthma, language impairment, and neuromuscular scoliosis. Stefon uses
          assistive devices for ambulation and requires support 100% of the time.
          For many years, Shareen was unable to work and unable to afford the type of services her son required
          from outside providers. She and her son lived in distressed neighborhoods in public housing and relied
          on food stamps to survive. Stefon’s assistive technology, environmental and therapeutic needs,
          although acknowledged, were not being met. They lived in survival mode, simply trying to overcome
          medical obstacles, one emergent event after the next. Their lives were dominated by doctor
          appointments, surgeries, and training for Shareen to provide Stefon with the care he needed in order to
          stay at home.
          In 2000, the family received a Medicaid waiver for critical services, and finally Stefon began to thrive.
          Medicaid made it possible for the family to train someone to provide supports for Stefon. He was able
          to get into a day program where he could continue to receive socialization and integration within the
          community, when his health permitted. His mother was able to work outside of the home with peace of
          mind knowing that Stefon’s needs were being met while still playing an integral part in all key decisions.
          Stefon is now able to live at home, and his mother has been able to thrive in her professional life and
          have a personal life. Her employment has eased the family’s long-standing financial burden. Stefon is
          now much happier. He has graduated from high school, attended his senior prom, and even won
          national recognition for athletic achievement.
          He still has health battles and major surgeries ahead. But without Medicaid, Stefon would lose his vital
          services and his mom probably would have to quit her job and get back on public assistance to take care
          of him. His quality of life would be dramatically reduced.
